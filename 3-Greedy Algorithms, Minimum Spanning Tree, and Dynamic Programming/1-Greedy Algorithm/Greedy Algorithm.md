### Greedy Algorithm

-**Given a greedy algorithm**, we often **won't** even **have a very good intuition for whether or not they are correct**.

â€‹	-Even with a **correct greedy algorithm**, it's often **hard to figure out why it's correct**.

*DANGER: Most greedy algorithms are **not correct**, even if your intuition says it's correct!*
