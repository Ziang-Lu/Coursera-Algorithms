### Dynamic Programming

Principles of Dynamic Programming:

* Identify a **small** number of subproblems

* Can quickly + correctly **solve "larger" subproblems given the solutions to "smaller" subproblems** (Usually via recusion)

  At a given subproblem, given the solutions to all of the smaller subproblems, it's easier to infer the solution to the given subproblem.

  i.e., Solutions to previous subproblems are sufficient to quickly and correctly to compute the solution to the current problem.
