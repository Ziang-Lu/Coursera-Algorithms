Application of *"Solve in exponential time, but faster than brute-force way"* to deal with NP-complete problems

### Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)

#### Problem Definition

Classical problem; problem definition omitted

<br>

This problem can be solved in a brute-force way, namely $n!$ permutations of the destinations.

By dynamic programming, this problem can be solved in O($2^n$) exponential-time.
