### 2-SAT Problem

#### Problem Definition

Classical problem; problem definition omitted

<br>

A special form of "constraint satisfaction problem (约束补偿问题 / 约束满足问题)".

Generally, **3-SAT problem** is **NP-complete**.

However, by simplifying the problem to **2-SAT problem**, it **can be solved in polynomial-time ($\in P$)** using a <u>local search algorithm</u>.
