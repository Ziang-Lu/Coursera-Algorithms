## Shortest Paths Revisited, NP-Complete Problems and What To Do About Them

#### Shortest Paths Revisit

* Bellman-Ford's Algorithm

#### All-Pair Shortest Paths

* Floyd-Warshall's Algorithm

#### NP-Complete Problems

* Approach 1-Focus on some computationally tractable special cases   (=> Exact algorithms)

  * Maximum-Weight Independent Set
  * 2-SAT

* Approach 2-Solve in exponential-time, but faster than brute-force way   (=> Exact algorithms)

  * Knapsack with Dynamic Programming-Based Algorithm
  * Vertex Cover
  * Traveling Salesman

* Approach 3-Use heuristics (efficient algorithms that are not always correct)   (=> Approximate algorithm)

  Frequently-used heuristic design paradigms:

  * Greedy
    * Knapsack with Greedy-Based Heuristic
  * Dynamic programming
    * Knapsack with Dynamic Programming-Based Heuristic
  * Local search
